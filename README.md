# Ski Resort Analysis
This project analyzes ski resorts using Python programming language and Microsoft PowerBI. The original data is in the "original_data" folder. Python was used to load, clean, and analyze the data, as well as draw conclusions from visualizations. Check "ski_resort.ipynb" for the Python analysis. The "powerbi_analysis" folder contains PowerBI visualizations created using the "ski_resort_snow.xlsx" dataset from the Python analysis in the "my_data" folder.
