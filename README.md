# Ski Resort Analysis
This project analyzes ski resorts using Python programming language and Microsoft PowerBI. The original data is in the "original_data" folder. Python was used to load, clean, and analyze the data, as well as draw conclusions from visualizations. Check "ski_resort.ipynb" for the Python analysis. The "powerbi_analysis" folder contains PowerBI visualizations created using the "ski_resort_snow.xlsx" dataset from the Python analysis in the "my_data" folder.

The threshold for considering a dataset as skewed depends on the context and the specific statistical analysis being performed. Generally speaking, if the absolute value of the skewness is greater than 1, the dataset can be considered significantly skewed. However, the interpretation of the skewness value depends on the distribution of the data and the specific goals of the analysis.
